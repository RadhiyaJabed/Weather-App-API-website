# Weather-App-API-website

The website requests the users location on the inital loading of the website, if granted permission it will automatically give the user the weather forecast of their location. If not granted the user will get a default weather forecast for London in England. An accompanying background is shown depending on where the location is.

Currently, the website supports weather forecasts for anywhere within Great Britain, but I will be improving this soon so that it includes the rest of the world.

Upcoming improvements also include load times.
